# 12. Week 12
Congratulations, you've made it to the end of the course! This is our revision week, we don't have any new material to introduce. 

At the University of Manchester we'll have our guest lecture, and we'll go over a mock exam. Details of these are available on [Canvas](./chapters/week10/lab_q_stage_1.md)

We also have a final [formative quiz](./chapters/week12/formative_quiz.md) which brings together questions from every part of the course.
